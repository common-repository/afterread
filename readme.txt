Provides suggestions to readers at the end of articles about what to do next, ie; read related articles, donate, read next article in category, etc.

== Description ==
What do you show the reader after they have read your content? Do you show them an empty comment box? A small unrelated block of automated text?
Instead use afterRead to present an active post footer driving visitors back into the site, don't waste a prime opportunity.  Presently afterRead's options are focused on driving visitors back into other related articles, but afterRead is capable of much more so expect to see new innovative Suggestions.


Features:

* Add Previous and Next post links to the bottom of posts.  These links can potentially be to any post, to only posts in the same category, or even only to posts with a matching tag. By default there are three styles to choose from, these styles integrate well with most themes.

* Suggestions can be anything from a donate button to a subscribe button to anything you can imagine.

* afterRead is modular and made of two primary parts, the afterRead core, and afterRead suggestions.This allows for updates that do not revert changes and for easy custom extension of functionality.

* You can easily add new suggestions by simply pasting code into a text box in the afterRead settings page

== Installation ==

1. Upload `afterread' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to the afterRead settings page found under the "Settings" menu
1. Select a different suggestion or use the default

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Suggestion? =

A Suggestion is anything you want to encourage the reader to do once they have finished reading, commonly a link to other posts. A Suggestion file is a php file which afterRead core uses to generate a Suggestion.

= Do I need PHP or HTML knowledge to use afterRead? =

No, I have attempted to make afterRead extremely usable for anyone with limited knowledge or no knowledge of HTML and PHP. If there is a feature you're confused about just tell me so that I can improve the documentation.

= I have an idea for a new Suggestion =

Perfect, the more Suggestions the better. If you get me an image of what you would like it to look like then I can see about coding it, I can't promise I will be able to add it but I will certainly consider it.

= When using tag based Suggestions the links seem random =

This is quite confusing to see, but it's actually logical. To illustrate this say we have a post, this post was made on the 20th and has a 'cooking' tag. Say there is then another post made on the 18th that had the 'cooking' tag and a 'book' tag, this will cause the 20th's post to link to the 18th's, now pretend that there was a post made on the 19th that only had the book tag, this will cause the 18th's post to link to the 19th's post and not the post made on the 20th.

= When using category based Suggestions the links seem random =

The same thing can happen for categories as happens with tags in the above question, it is less common because it is rather rare to add a post in two categories.

= The Add Suggestion field in the settings page does not work =

This can happen if the unix write permmisons do not allow the script to create new files. To fix it you have to change the write permisions and reactivate afterRead.
